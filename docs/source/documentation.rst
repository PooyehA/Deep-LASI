*Deep-LASI* comes with an interactive graphical user interface (GUI) to perform processing and analysis tasks during the data evaluation. This page serves for documenting its functionalities. *Deep-LASI* comes with six integrated GUI sub-windows for analyzing the data and one menubar for handling the data reading, the settings of the program, and simulating single-molecule data. The analysis-GUIs are dedicated to (1) opening and molecule identification, (2) mapping and trace extraction, (3) trace categorization, selection, trace correction/analysis, (4) SNR analysis of traces, (5) the summary of the results including FRET, States, correction factors and TDP plots, and (6) the classical HMM analysis via different software packages.

To start learning how to use *Deep-LASI*, we recommend, first, reading through the :doc:`starter` and :doc:`example` sections. 
A step-wise description of how to analyze different single-molecule data with *Deep-LASI* is given for selected showcases in the :doc:`example` in detail.

Data requirements
-------------------

Data handling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*Deep-LASI* incorporates single molecule data at different levels. First of all, it reads movies from emCCD or sCMOS cameras, as usually acquired using a wide-field total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscope. Consecutively, it extracts the intensity information of single and co-localizing molecules depending on the excitation scheme and assay and saves the extracted traces afterwards. For already recorded intensity time traces from confocal microscopy and localization microscopy, *Deep-LASI* imports the trajectories as formerly saved without additional correction. :numref:`data-flow` summarizes the data handling.

   Workflow summarizing the generic data formats used by *Deep-LASI*, as well as supported data formats for trace import.

Supported Data Formats
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*Deep-LASI* was developed to handle movie files containing single-molecule data. Nevertheless, it can also import recorded data from other sources (see below). We are happy to support further standard image formats to make *Deep-LASI* compatible with other systems and software packages. For more specialized / home-built setups and data formats, we recommend first reading the :ref:`custom-file` section before getting in touch with us in the Forum and/or via ...

**TIFF, Tagged Image File Format (.tif)**

*Deep-LASI* accepts movie files in the Tagged Image File Format (*.tif*). These files can contain stacks of wide-field/TIRF images with
one or multiple detection channels for different laser excitation schemes. Choose this file format if you want to load raw data from, e.g., emCCD cameras. 

**PicoQuant universal file format (.ptu)**

*Deep-LASI* can handle confocal data obtained by scanning laser microscopy in 'Pick-n-destroy' mode. Single time traces saved in the PicoQuant universal file format (*.ptu*) can be read consecutively. So far only single-channel read-in is supported and tested on .PTU files recorded using HydraHarp Software V3.0.

**Hierarchical Data Format 5 (.hdf5)**

To analyze data files from localization microscopy extracted and generated with `Picasso <https://picassosr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_, we extended *Deep-LASI* also to read in the binary file format Photon-HDF5 (*.hdf5*) as described on `http://photon-hdf5.github.io <http://photon-hdf5.github.io>`_. For every localization event the raw photon stream is loaded while missing localizations default to 0 intensity.

..  _custom-files:
**Custom file formats**

The vast number of different commercial and custom-built microscope setups makes it fairly impossible to host all data and file formats that could be analyzed in *Deep-LASI*. We, therefore, designed a spot in the file type selection for a custom read-in routine. These routines are saved in the *import folder* and must be a MATLAB file (*.m*) with a specific structure which can be found in all other import functions.


Saved File Formats
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For data import and storage, *Deep-LASI* saves and handles three further file types:

..  csv-table:: Data Types
   :header: "Format", "Data Types"
   :widths: 15, 200

   *.mat,   "File containing the extracted or imported traces"
   *.tdat,  "File containing the mapping information and saved data sets"
   *.npz,   "File containing simulated traces"

Files ending with *.mat* contain extracted or already imported traces. Mat-Files are the standard format by *Deep-LASI* using the MATLAB Data format.
How to access and, or read, this data externally is described in more detail in :ref:`data-structure`.

Files ending with *.tdat are generated after mapping different detection channels. They contain information about how camera images between different channels refer to each other, i.e., about potential translational and rotational offsets, as well as differences in magnification. :ref:`mapping` files are generated before trace extraction, usually via a separate movie showing a calibration pattern or multi-labeled particles, and used for matching single-molecule co-localizations between different channels.

Files ending with *.npz refer to simulated single-molecule traces as described in the :doc:`sim` page. They are read in directly for trace analysis. 


..  _data-structure:
Data structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Most data in *Deep-LASI* is stored as global variables in the background to allow easy access. They are saved in the *transportable* structure *T*, which can be extracted at any point of the analysis to the workspace by typing :code:`>> global T` in the command line of MATLAB. The most important variables are:

..  csv-table:: Data format
   :header: "Variable", "Content and format"
   :widths: 15, 200

   T.Channel,        "Container for all the information for each camera"
   T.Channel.Traces, "All intensity and FRET traces sorted according to the excitation cycle"
   T.ALEXsequence,   "Excitation color for each frame"
   T.FrameTime,      "Exposure time including frame transfer"
   T.HMM,            "Container for all parameters and results obtained from Hidden Markov models"
   T.NeuralNetwork,  "Container for all loaded neural networks and prediction results"


.. ..  _profile:
.. User-specific settings
.. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. *Deep-LASI* uses profiles to allow the users to work efficiently with data from different setups, configurations, assays or simply analysis folders.
.. It stores user-specific settings locally in the same MATLAB folder as *settings.mat* and *user_default_setting.mat*. *settings.mat* contains variables, on the path to the last working folder as well as camera specific settings. *user_default_setting.mat* contains a structure called *userdef* which comprises 34 fields with user specific variables when analyzing datasets

..  _import:
Data Import from OT and TRACY 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This function is for internal use within Fablab only.  
*Deep-LASI* allows for importing FRET data obtained from `Multi-Color Orbital Tracking <https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smll.202204726>`_ measurements using the setup specific data format. 

*TRACY* was the former software for the evaluation of 1c and 2c FRET traces. *Deep-LASI* allows for importing the formerly exported and evaluated traces, as well as to export new data sets into the old format.


--------------------------------------------------------------------

Processing Single-Molecule Data
-------------

..  _opening:
Starting Deep-LASI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To evaluate your experimental data with *Deep-LASI*, please open the program from the MATLAB command window by typing in :code:`>> TRacer`. TRacer is the core-program responsible for data import, trace extraction, as well as and manual selection and sorting. After a couple of seconds, the Start-GUI of the program will open as shown in :numref:`open-program`.

.. figure:: ./../figures/documents/Tracer_FirstPage.png
   :width: 650
   :alt: Open Deep-LASI
   :align: center
   :name: open-program

   The Main-GUI of Deep-LASI has six sub-windows for data processing and analysis.

Deep-LASI shows one empty Main-GUI together with six integrated sub-windows for analyzing the data and one menubar for handling the data reading, the settings of the program, and the simulation of single-molecule data.

Menu Bar
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Basic functionalities of *Deep-LASI* such as data handling, program settings, or the training of new neural networks for data analysis are controlled via the *Menu Bar*. It has the following five drop-down menus

..  csv-table:: Menu Bar Entries
   :widths: 15, 200

   *File*,   "Functions for loading, mapping, processing, saving, importing and exporting data"
   *Settings*,"Access to Camera Settings"
   *View*,   "Appearance of the GUI, Graphs and Data representation"
   *Tools*,  "Programs for accessing/simulating single-molecule data, and training Neural Networks"
   *Help*,   "Contact data for help in case of problems"
   *Reset*,  "Restart of Deep-LASI and clearance of all variable of the program"


**Dropdown Menu File.**
The dropdown menu *File* (:numref:`file-menu`) controls all steps from loading the experimental data, over mapping, background correction, trace extraction and saving of traces. Moreover, it facilitates the import and export of different data formats as described in the :ref:`data-format` section. The dropdown menu hosts seven sub-routines:

#. The sub-routines in **Mapping** are used to match the corresponding image pixels between up to four different cameras. They allow the user to generate, save and reload maps containing the transformation matrices between the channels. A description of how to map the detection channels is given below in the :ref:`data-format` section.

#. **Load Image Data** facilitates the read-in of data files per detection channels. The data needs to be read in consecutively starting with Channel 1 being the most 'blue'-shifted detection channel and Channel 4 the most 'red'-shifted detection channel. Data loading is possible for a single file per channel, but also for multiple files at once. ::warning:: Please make sure: (1) that the numbers of loaded files per detection channel match and (2) that the files have consecutive numbering, so that corresponding movies are loaded.

#. Using the **Load Traces/State** routine, previously extracted and potentially already evaluated traces can be reloaded into *Deep-LASI*.

#. The **Add Traces/State** routine allows to add further extracted traces to already loaded traces. This function is especially useful for merge traces from various measurements. ::warning:: Please make sure that only traces with identical experimental settings (i.e., number of frames, exposure time and in particular laser excitation)  can be merged.

#. **Save Traces/State** to save desired changes on traces for example in case of having done analysis steps.

#. The **Import** function allows to load data sets from other single-molecule measurements (as described in the :ref:`data-format` section above). The imported traces are only loaded and not further modified by *Deep-LASI*.

#. **Export** allows for transferring extracted traces to a former analysis software used by the hosting group and to save and export traces as well as single traces in graphic formats.

#. **Quit** terminates the program.

   TRacer file menu


**Dropdown Menu Settings** |br|
The dropdown menu **Settings** opens an sub-window for entering the camera hardware settings built in the experimental setup. The routine asks for the EM Gain factor, the camera baseline in dark counts and the number of photons per camera count for each camera, so that *Deep-LASI* can convert the  determined intensity in arbitrary units into Counts per seconds, i.e. Hertz.

**Dropdown Menu View** |br|
The third dropdown menu **View** allows for changing the appearance and settings in graphical interfaces on the different GUI sub-windows of Deep-LASI.
* The sub-tab **Colormap** changes the color palette in 3D plots, e.g. on the Trace GUI surface, which show small zoomed in areas of 24x24 pixels. These show the area around localized molecules in each channel, surrounded by the background mask, to control for possible impurities in the background. The default colormap is *jet*.
* The **Plot Units** sub-tab controls affect the following seven different axes settings for plotting the background and intensities of different channels, as well as FRET efficiencies for single single-molecule trajectories :

..  csv-table:: Plot Units Entries
   :widths: 15, 200

   *Photons (Cam. calibrated)*,   "Intensity shown as absolute numbers of photons"
   *Mean accross Particle Mask*,  "Intensity shown as mean intensity within the detection mask"
   *QY/Det. Eff (gamma)*,         "Intensity after gamma correction"
   *Spectral crosstalk (beta)*,   "Intensity after correction against spectral crosstalk"
   *Direct Excitation (alpha)*,   "Intensity after correction against direct excitation"
   *Raw Trace (no BG subtr.)*,    "Intensity without background correction"
   *Corrected FRET*,              "Display of accurate FRET instead of apparent FRET"

.. tip:: @ Simon, what precisely is plotted, i.e. which axis is changed and how ??

Checking/unchecking of the different sub-tabs immediately updates the graphical interface and the way how a single-molecule trace is displayed.

The first sub-tab, **Photons(Cam.calibrated)**, converts the intensity axis into the absolut number of photons being detected by the individual cameras during a particular excitation cycle.
The second sub tab, **'Mean Across Particle Mask**, shows the mean emission intensity of the particle within the detection mask on the y axis. The correction factors **gamma**, **beta**, and **alpha** could be separately applied to the intensity traces. One can also choose to cancel the background subtraction from the intensity traces, and have them as raw intensities. With the last option you can choose to have the corrected FRET efficiency on the corresponding panel. Of course for the correction factors to be incorporated on the traces, you should have them already determined.

With the **Reset** button, you can restart the TRacer program, meaning that whatever you did or changed on the program will be discarded unless you had it saved.

..  _mapping:
Mapping
-------------

If mapping is required between two or more cameras, go to **Mapping** from the menu under file. Then choose ‘Create New Map’ and the ‘First Channel’. You can see the path on figure 3.

.. image:: ./../figures/documents/Fig_3_Mapping_Menu.png
   :width: 500
   :alt: Open mapping menu
   :align: center
   
Figure 3. Mapping menu

Now the program will ask you to choose a file which could be an image or a series of images as a video file usually taken from a calibration pattern like a zero-mode waveguide. After choosing the file, the image gets open together with some adjusting options, like figure 4.

.. image:: ./../figures/documents/Fig_4_Map_Image_Uploading.png
   :width: 300
   :alt: map uploading
   :align: center 
   
Figure 4. Uploading first mapping image

On the window opened for the user, you can use the **Channel Layout** to take the desired field of view. You can take the whole area or select a specific region with the buttons provided for that. There are also the options of rotating or flipping the image, so that all images from various cameras show the same pattern. Then click on OK. The image will be open on the mapping tab, figure 5. 

.. image:: ./../figures/documents/Fig_5_Map_Image_Detecting.png
   :width: 300
   :alt: map detection
   :align: center

Figure 7. Adjusting the image for the second mapping image

After opening the mapping images from all the cameras, select which channel you prefer to be the reference channel, like figure 8. In most cases, the first channel is taken as the reference one unless you have a special mapping plan.

.. image:: ./../figures/documents/Fig_8_Mapping_Starting.png
   :width: 300
   :alt: start mapping
   :align: center

Figure 8. Performing the mapping step

Then click on **Start Mapping**. The mapping process goes quit fast and gives the mapping result as before and after images like figure 9. It is recommended to check the quality of mapping. In some cases you might have to take new images for this step if the image quality you uploaded was not acceptable which is a rare event! 
   
.. image:: ./../figures/documents/Fig_9_Map_Before_After.png
   :width: 300
   :alt: check mapping
   :align: center
   
Figure 9. Mapping result

After mapping, the extraction tab opens showing a detection mask created like the one shown on the top right part of figure 10. This mask is used to calculate the emission intensity of the particle inside the central circle, and also the background within the outer ring. The user has the freedom to change the mask settings when needed. You have the option of saving the created map or loading a previous map from the same mapping menu.

.. image:: ./../figures/documents/Fig_10_Map_Saving.png
   :width: 300
   :alt: check mapping
   :align: center

Loading the data 
-------------
 
Now you can open the data files from file menu and **Load Image Data** similar to opening the mapping images like shown on figure 11. The order of channels should be the same as mapping order. 
 
.. image:: ./../figures/documents/Fig_11_Data_Loading.png
   :width: 300
   :alt: loading first channel
   :align: center
   
Figure 11. The menu for loading image data 

TRacer asks you to choose the data files, and you can open all the files from each channel at a time. After a short time, the following window (figure 12) will open to take the measurement parameters. The first box is for the sum of exposure time and frame transfer. For example in case of measuring with the exposure time of 50 ms, and the frame transfer of 2.2 ms, we can enter 52.2.

.. image:: ./../figures/documents/Fig_12_Measurement_Parameters.png
   :width: 300
   :alt: inserting measurement parameters
   :align: center
   
Figure 12. The window for specifying measurement parameters 

The second box is to get the ALEX sequence used for illuminating the sample. Different combinations of two or three laser excitation can be entered here. Note that for the IR laser, you should only enter the letter ‘I’. The letter ‘G’ works for lasers in green or yellow region. Then you put the slider on the corresponding channel, for example, on the image shown here on the left or right position depending on reading data from first or second channel. It gets three divisions in case of a three-channel experiment.

Then choose which frames you want to load on the program by using the **Load frame range**. Also depending on the experiment, you can choose the range of desired frames for detecting the particles and extracting their intensity traces. TRacer takes all the frames by default and you can change them as you wish.

The option of choosing the dye does nothing at the moment, but a library of various dyes could be added to the program so that dye specific information help us with a more complete analysis.

As the last step here, click on the corresponding channel color from the four options provided. Now TRacer opens the first data file from the range that you selected, like figure 13.

.. image:: ./../figures/documents/Fig_13_Detecting_Particles.png
   :width: 300
   :alt: first channel detection
   :align: center
   
Figure 13. Particle detection for the first channel data 

The sliders below the image are to adjust the display contrast, and detection threshold so that one gets more particles detected. The detected particles are inside a triangle within the image, and the number of them is shown in the box next to the image on the top right position.

Continue opening the data images for the next channel(s) from the same menu, as shown on figure 14.

   :width: 300
   :alt: loading second channel

Each time you load image files, the pop-up window appears asking you about the channel color to extract the data in the correct order.

Figure 15. Updating measurement parameters

The example figures show a two-color measurement. As shown on figure 15, we put the slider on the second half to indicate the second channel (the same procedure works for the third channel by putting the slider to the most right position.), and also click on the R to indicate the acceptor channel (red in this case). After a short time the first frame of the second channel overlays on the image from the first one.

Figure 16. Detection of particles and their co-localization 

The color of triangles show the detected emitters on each corresponding channel and the circles show the co-localized particles. All the numbers are also reported in the small box on the top.

You can decide which particles you want to analyze using the options in the right box **Trace Selection** and then click on **Extract Traces**. In the example shown on figure 17 only the co-localized particles are considered to study their FRET.

Intensity Traces
-------------

After the extraction step which might take a while depending on the amount of data loaded, the resulting traces will open on the next tab called **Traces** as shown on figure 18 for both two- and three-color measurements. You can see on the left side that 6100 two-color traces were extracted from the loaded data set.

.. image:: ./../figures/documents/Fig_18_Trace.png
   :width: 700
   :alt: trace
   :align: center
   
Figure 18. Exemplary traces for a two-color measurement on the left, and three-color on the right

On figure 18 on the left, you see the time trace of both donor and acceptor in the left upper panel. Because of illuminating the sample using ALEX mode, a lot of information are available on each trace. The gray plot is the total intensity on the donor channel which in theory is expected to have a stable value before a bleaching step. The green trace is the signal of donor after donor excitation, the red trace is the emission of acceptor after donor excitation (FRET), and the dark red is the emission of acceptor after acceptor excitation. You can choose which intensity trace be shown from the right box **Plot Layout** by checking or unchecking the corresponding boxes.

The lower panel in orange, is the time trace of FRET efficiency. You can also choose which efficiency trace to see. It especially comes handy in case of having more than one FRET pair like the case shown on the right part. In the middle column, the detected particle on each channel is shown inside the detection mask, and in addition to the trace information this can also help to decide if we have a single molecule or not. For example you should see one emitter in the middle and no particle sitting on the background ring, since it will falsify the background calculation.

For a three-color measurement, you will get an additional panel. As shown on figure 18 on the right, the top panel consists of all the intensities after the blue excitation in the blue channel. So the dark blue is the emission of the blue dye after blue excitation, the light blue is the emission of green dye after the blue excitation, and the purple trace is the emission of red dye after blue excitation. The rest of the panels are the same as described before.

With the **navigation** slider you can go through all traces, and with the **classification** part, you can manually categorize your traces into several categories based on your analysis needs, see an example on figure 19. All traces are by default in the **Uncategorized** section, by clicking on the plus sign you can add more categories, rename, and also assign keyboard letters to transfer them to a corresponding category by simply pressing the assigned key.

.. note:: You can not assign the letters **A**, **D**, or **E** to your categories. These are the keys that you can use to go to the previous trace (A), the next trace (D), and have the program select analysis region for you (E).

You can also delete an unwanted category with the trash can icon or uncheck the filter box to prevent them being visible. It is especially helpful for the trash category for example. When you assign a trace to a specific category, it will be automatically removed from the first **Uncategorized** one.

.. image:: ./../figures/documents/Fig_19_Categories.png

   :align: center
   
Figure 19. Navigation and categorization

For selecting the desired region on each trace for further analysis, you can drag the mouse to make the selected region shadowed, for example from the beginning of a trace until a bleaching step. By clicking on the trace region, the mouse turns to an active cursor for a general selection for example when all the dyes are active. TRacer will use the first bleaching step to calculate the correction factors. If you want to select channel specific regions, press the numbers 1,2,… to indicate the channel with the same order you loaded the images, and then you can select the region by the cursor special to each channel like the example on figure 20 for the red channel as the second one. For other channels the cursor shows the other corresponding letters like B, G, and I.

Figure 20. Activated cursor specific for red channel 

The next photo shows an example of region selection for both green and red channels. Here the FRET efficiency trace gets the selection until the first bleaching step, and this region will be added to the FRET histogram in the end. 

The correction factors calculated from each trace are in the **FRET control** box on the lower right corner. If a trace is not suitable for calculating the correction factors, then the median value of the whole data set would be applied on that.

After having all the traces categorized, you can move on to the **Histograms** tab (figure 22), choose the category you want which are the same as you defined (figure 23), and get information about your data as histograms already fitted. Information such as the total signal, background level, count-rate, signal to noise ratio, and bleaching time, figure 24. The fitting results are provided in a table on the right side.

After choosing the category, you can select from the **Plot Mode** which plot to get. In the example shown on figure 26, you get the histogram of apparent FRET efficiency, like the one in figure 27.

There are options in **Display Settings** (see figure 28) to make the frame-wise and/or molecule-wise plot visible, normalize them, and also to fit them by choosing the best fitting method. If sometimes fitting seems so wrong, you can manually insert some values based on what you roughly see on the plot, fix them and fit again. By playing around the fitting gets better, then you can uncheck the fixing boxes and let the program find the best fitting values. You can also change the color of your plot(s) by clicking on the colored rectangle and choose a desired color.

On the HMM tab, you can again select a category and run the HMM on it. This option works for two-color measurements at the moment. There are some other options for analysis the kinetics of a three-color measurement which will come shortly in the following parts.

Automated Analysis by Deep Learning
-------------

In case you want to save time and not go through all the analysis steps manually which might take days and even weeks especially for categorizing, you can use the automated analysis provided in the **Deep Learning** tab, Figure 31. This is an additional program using pre-trained deep neural networks incorporated into TRacer.

The simplest way to get your final results is to click on **Magic Button** (figure 32) and the program will do all the steps of categorization, correction, and dynamics analysis for you! All neural network models are chosen automatically dependent on the number of channels in your data set. The first step is the categorization of all traces. Note, that only dynamic traces reaching the confidence threshold (editable the deep learning tab) will be included in the category 'Dynamic (filtered)' and further analyzed. The **Magic Button** simply calls a series of functions which you also have access to individually, namely **Categorize Traces**, **Autocorrect**, **Number of States** and **State Transitions**. For the prediction of state transitions you have more freedom if you call the function separately. For example, you can run the prediction on fully corrected data, choose a specific model in case you have prior knowledge about the system or feed all frames into the state classifier without prior categorization of the trace classifier.

After trace classification, auto calculation of all available correction factors is performed. Figure 33 shows the histograms of the extracted direct excitation, crosstalk and gamma factors with the corresponding median, mean, and mode values. Gamma factors are calculated 3-fold for median, mean and mode values of direct excitation and crosstalk to show you the influence of these globally used correction factors on the gamma factor. The total number of traces and frames used for the calculation of each correction factor is displayed above the histograms.

After trace classification and correction, the number of states classifier will predict the most probable number of states for each trace. The corresponding confidence values will be shown in a pop up histogram.

The predictions of the number of states classifier are used for model selection of the state transition classifier, which subsequently sort all frames in the dynamic traces into state occupancy. Figures 35 and 36 show a histogram of state-wise FRET efficiency and trace-wise state confidence, respectively.

After all neural network predictions are completed, the program asks you to choose the number of bins, the confidence threshold and the number of states categories to include in the TDP (Transition Density Plot).

By clicking on **Select ROI**, you can choose a cluster and obtain dynamic information about it. The mean values of dwell time, initial and final FRET, and the number of transitions appear on the rext box to the right. The live fit panel below fits the selected dwell times with an exponential. By choosing the **Fit Selection**, **Fit Upper Triangle** or **Fit Lower Triangle** you can fit the dwell times using the Curve Fitting Toolbox™ from MATLAB (not available in compiled programs!). **Plot Dwell times** will plot the dwell times of the selected transitions in a histogram. **Plot FRET** and **Plot corr. FRET** show you the histogrammed apparent and corrected FRET efficiency of the selection, respectively. In case of 3-color FRET data, the FRET efficiencies of all other dye pairs are shown as well.

Magic button is the fully automated step. You may also intend to take separate and different analysis steps without the magic button. For that, you first need to load a neural network from the same table of **Trace Tools**, figure 41. First choose the closest option to your measurement from the drop-down menu on the right, and then click on **Load Neural Network**. Then with the options provided you can do the necessary analysis on your data and get the results within a couple of minutes. Note that to do the autocorrect, you should first click on **Categorize** and then click on **Autocorrect**. After having the categories made by the software, you always have the option of going through the traces, make any changes, and save the current status of the data set.
